        <h2>Rulon Briscoe</h2>
        <h3>Code Review</h3>
        <p>Code reviews are a critical part of software development that allows the developer to make sure they adhere to best practices. This is an opportunity to collaborate and share knowledge about the project making the code more maintainable. It also fosters better communication between team members. In this code review, I went over the original project completed in a previous class to see which areas could be improved upon. This is a code review of a mobile app that I made to keep track of inventory in a warehouse.</p>

        <h3>Project 1: Software Engineering and Design</h3>
        <p>The artifact that I used for all three projects in this portfolio will display improvements in three different categories: Software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. For the first project, I was able to redesign the user interface and add more accessibility and navigational components for an overall better experience for the user. The pictures at the bottom will show that I added features to the secure login screen such as forgot username and password links and a create account button for first-time users.</p>

        <h4>Key Features:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Secure login for previous users</li>
            <li>Create account button for new users</li>
            <li>New navigational features</li>
            <li>New print button</li>
            <li>New floating action point button to add inventory</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Code Snippet:</h4>
        <pre><code># Example code snippet
def example_function():
    print("Hello, world!")
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Project 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
        <p>For this app, I added several tables using SQLite, which is a quick and secure way to store and access data on a mobile app. SQLite is lightweight but powerful, making it the ideal software library for this project.</p>

        <h4>Key Features:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New SQLite table for a secure login</li>
            <li>New SQLite table to store inventory items</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Code Snippet:</h4>
        <pre><code>// Example code snippet
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Project 3: Databases</h3>
        <p>For the database section of my project, I was able to implement a fast, self-contained database using SQLite to provide secure logins and an easy-to-use inventory page to keep track of items in a warehouse.</p>

        <h4>Key Features:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New SQLite database that supports ACID transactions</li>
            <li>Lightweight and secure database features</li>
            <li>Serverless operations</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Code Snippet:</h4>
        <pre><code>-- Example code snippet
SELECT * FROM example_table;
        </code></pre>
